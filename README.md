# Supervised-project-1
The purpose of our project is to create decisional tools that will help to understand the futur impact of climatic constraints on cereal production in the Limagne plain. To solve our problem, we used a data set of climate forecasts from 2006 to 2100, which was divided into 45 points located in the Limagne plain (all these points are separated and each point is 8 km apart). Thanks to RStudio software, we created different functions : The first one is calculating statistical summaries of the different indicators and is creating graph comparing our indicators with past data. We also created a function that is using spatial interpolation to create maps in order to group all the similar points. We also did conformity tests, and linear filtering. By using an automatic classification method PCA - Principal Component Analysis, we can group our spatial points more easily.
